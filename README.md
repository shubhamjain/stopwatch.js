stopwatch-js
============

Nothing fancy to write about as it is just a terminal emulation and a stopwatch command built over it. I wrote it just for an aeshic feel with no practical purpose intended; perhaps, a (rube goldberg machine)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine].

To use it type "stopwatch" and press enter. You can build more commands by following the source code. I am too lazy to write any more, mail me for any query.
