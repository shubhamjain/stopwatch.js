Stopwatch.js
============

It is just a terminal emulation and a stopwatch command built over it. [Demo Here](http://shubhamjain.github.io/stopwatch.js). I wrote it with no practical purpose intended.

To use it type "stopwatch" and press enter. You can build more commands by following the source code. Send a follow-up on my email for any query.
